The organization works to ensure that people with seizures are able to participate in all life experiences; to improve how people with epilepsy are perceived, accepted and valued in society; and to promote research for a cure. The proceeds from this event will help continue to provide valuable research for a cure to people suffering from epilepsy.</p>
        <p class="lead">Please help to make this event a memorable and successful one. Together with your support, we can make this an annual event that will bring people together as well as raise funds for this important organization every year.</p>
